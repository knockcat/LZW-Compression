[1] Stepping through the start of the algorithm for this string, you can see that in the first pass through the loop,
a check is performed to see if the string "^W" is in the table. Since it isn't, the code for '^' is output, and the string "^W" is
added to the table. Since we have 256 characters already defined for codes 0-255, the first string definition can be assigned to code
256. After the third letter, 'E', has been read in, the second string code "WE" is added to the table and the code for letter 'W' is
output. This continues until in the second word, the characters '^' and 'W' are read in, matching string number 256. In this case, the
code 256 is output, and a three character string is added to the string table.
The process continues until the string is exhausted and all of the codes have been output.
